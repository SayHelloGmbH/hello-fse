/**
 * VH is the viewport height. This works fine in most browsers,
 * but Safari changes the vieport height on scrolling, which
 * messes up calculations based on vh. The new viewport unit svh
 * is being introduced, which is the smallest viewport height,
 * i.e. the viewport height before Safari fucks it up.
